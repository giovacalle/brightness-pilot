## If you want to try

Until this extension is accepted into the Raycast Store, you can try it locally:

1. Download this repository
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server (just for 'building' the extension then you can stop it)
4. Now you can open Raycast and type "Brightness Pilot" to use the extension
